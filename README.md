# [Recipe Book]

As practice, I intend to create a small website with recipes from my recipe binder.

See a preview here: **[Recipe Book]**

## Goals

- Become more comfortable with HTML and CSS.
- Make the pages responsive and look good on all devices.
- Make sure that printed pages render correctly and look good.
- Add a page to add pages or edit already existing pages.
- Make a section for photos of the recipes?
