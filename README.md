# Recipe Book

As practice, I intend to create a website with recipes from my recipe binder.

## Goals

- Become more comfortable with HTML and CSS.
- Make the pages responsive and look good on all devices.
- Make sure that printed pages render correctly and look good.
- Add a page to add pages or edit already existing pages.
