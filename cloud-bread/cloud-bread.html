		<h1 class="noTopMargin">Steps</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat oven to 300F.</li>
			<li>Separate egg yolks from egg white.</li>
			<li>In one bowl, mix egg yolks, cream cheese, and sweetener.</li>
			<li>In another bowl, add cream of tartar to the egg whites and whisk until they form stiff peaks.</li>
			<li>Carefully fold the egg yolk mixture into the egg whites.</li>
			<li>Grease two baking sheets with cooking spray or butter.</li>
			<li>With a large spoon, spoon even rounds onto the baking sheets approximately the size of the top half of a hamburger bun.</li>
			<li>Bake on the middle rack of the oven for about half an hour. They are done when they become golden brown. Time will vary with ovens.</li>
		</ol>
		<aside class="tips centered">
			<h1 class="noTopMargin">Tips</h1>
			<p>When folding the yolk mixture into the egg whites, be very gentle because we want to avoid popping all the bubbles and losing the fluffiness of the egg whites. These bubbles are what make the bread fluffy and feel like bread.</p>
			<p>If you choose, you may substitute the cream cheese with an equal portion of whole milk cottage cheese.</p>
			<p class="noBottomMargin">If you store the finished product in an airtight container overnight, the next day the texture will be much more like bread, so make these a day ahead of time for the best texture.</p>
